            What were the inputs you gave the simulation?
            Initial population size: 10000
            Vaccinated percentage: 80%
            Name of the virus: test
            Mortality rate: 0.7
            Reproductive rate was: 0.1

        

            What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
            16% of the population became infected at some point before the virus burnt out.

         

            What percentage of the population died from the virus?
            9% of the population died from the virus.

        

            Out of all interactions (164000) sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
